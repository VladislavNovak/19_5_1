The astonished farmer took the ring given to him by the peasant woman, and went home.
In evening he came to a big city. There he went to a merchant and showed him the magic ring.
When the merchant heard the astonishing story, he thought of a plan.
He invited the farmer to stay in his house for the night.
At night he came up to the sleeping peasant, carefully took the ring off the manâ€™s finger,
and put on another ring, which looked exactly like the one he had taken off.
